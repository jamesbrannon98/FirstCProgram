# FirstCProgram

This project was designed in order to begin learning the C programming languages.
Each of the functions are independent of each other, and the .c, .h, and .o  files for
the project are all included.

The first function, smallest, iterates through as list of elements, and returns the the minimum
of the list by determining if the current element is less than the current minimum.

The second function, reverse, reads an array and returns the characters of the array in reverse order.

The third function, addOK, takes two integers as input, and determines if the two integers can be
added without underflow or overflow. If the addition of the integers does not cause overflow
or underflow, then 1 is returned. Otherwise, 0 is returned.
